###Reflection notes:
This project was overall, not too difficult. I think moreso than anything, this project taught me a lot about code management and how to manage a codebase. I managed to use a bit of helper functions, and I also tried to make use some more of the ES6 functionality that makes things a little easier. I experimented a bit to see how the code would look using different version of for loops/mapping, and also played around a bit with other ideas to try to make the website response.

I'm really happy with how responsive the website is overall, while I haven't checked it on mobile(yet), the preview seems to look okay (although i think it's going to be too small).

Organization of css is a nightmare. I really need to think about how to cascade css correctly and how to reduce needing to add many different classes and keeping things more functional.

I really want to think of a way to reduce having to type "document.querySelector()" a million times.

Overall, no other comments on this project. Somehow, it was overall relatively successful!

Key improvements:
Your organization was bad
work on helper functions
